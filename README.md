# UDLS

To install 

`python setup.py install`

In my environment, the resulting `egg` binary is located here:

`~/.pyenv/versions/3.9-dev/envs/py-rave/lib/python3.9/site-packages`

Therefore, to install a new version, get rid of the resulting egg file and install a new one.

`rm -rf udls-1.7-py3.9.egg`
